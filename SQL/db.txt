  3. easier to inserr,update or delete , etc

DBMS ?
- it is an additional layer above database which is used to organise data in database and handles all the queries for 
  updation and retrieval of data from db.

SQL Vs NOSQL ?
- SQL : Relational db(tabular) 
 1. MYSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL,etc

- NOSQL: non relational db > documents(key:val,graph,etc)
  1. MONGOdb, cassandra,Neo4j,etc, collection of db.

sql :- it is a programming language used to interact with relational db.
      it is a query language used to interact with relational db.

what is a table ?
- collection of row and column in a database.
- where column categorized the schema(design of the table) like id, name ,email, etc
- Row categorized the user distinctly with n numbers and also knwon as tuple(i.e single row)

Table queries:
create insert update alter truncate delete

-create table table_name(col_name,datatype,......);
-create databse database_name;
-show databases;
-drop database db_name;
-use db_name;
-create database if not exists db_name;


Constraint,

Not Null - columns cannot have a null value
unique - all values in column are different
default - set the default value of the column
check - it can limit the values allowed in a column 
        syntax constraint check(condition1 and condition2...)

key constraints: special columns in the table

Primary key - makes a column unique and not null but used only for one in a table.
              syntax create table tempo(id int not null,primary key(id));
            
            - it is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
      
Foreign key - prevent action that would destroy link between the tables.
              syntax create table tempoo(cust_id int,name,purchase, foreign key(cust_id) references temp(id));

            - a foreign key is a column or set of column in a table that refers to  the primary key in a table and 
              reference to another table as a foreign key .
            
            - FK can have duplicates and null values

            - There can be multiple foreign key in a table.


select command: 

- select col1,col2,.. from table_name;
- select * from table_name; (show all the data of the table)
- select distinct age from table_name;(return tuple of same values as one)


where clause : to efine some conditions

- select col1, col2, from table_name where condition;
operators in where :

- arithmetic operators : + - * / %
- comparison operator : = != > < >= <=
- logical operators : AND, OR, NOT, IN, BETWEEN, ALL, LIKE, ANY
- bitwise : &, |
